### Is 4% growth really only 4% growth?

First of all, what is normal? 

20% year-over-year for all types of houses in a city is very, *VERY* rare, even [Cupertino](http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Cupertino-California/market-trends/), [Los Gatos](http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Los_Gatos-California/market-trends/), and [Palo Alto](http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Palo_Alto-California/market-trends/), who have each seen home values rise more than 70% in one segment or another in the last year, haven't seen whole-market growth even close to 20%.  4% doesn't sound very good, especially when considering that the stock market as a whole [historically averages 10.4%](http://www.stockpickssystem.com/historical-rate-of-return/),
but that's not the whole story.

Think back a few years to the banking crisis and remember when all those investment banks were getting into trouble because they were too highly leveraged.  Leveraging is when you take out a loan to make an investment.  The problem the banks had was that they made bad investments so they couldn't pay back their loans.

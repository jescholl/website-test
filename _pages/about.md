### About Me

I am a Linux Admin, Network Engineer, Rubyist, and Finance Nerd.  I always knew
I wanted to work on computers when but never really knew what that meant.
I started out doing user support, hopped over to Linux servers, Windows servers,
and then finally back to Linux servers. 

You may be wondering what Finance and computers have in common, the answer is not much.
I got interested in Finance when I was working on my <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BS</abbr> in Information Systems,
and I just like playing with numbers, so deal with it :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.

### About This Blog

The goal of this blog is to share some of the things I've learned or things that
interest me in the areas of Computers, Networking, or Finance.  Those may
sound like scary topics but don't run away just yet. I've never been a big fan of most jargon, so
everything will be explained as simply as possible.
